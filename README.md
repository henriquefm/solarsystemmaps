# Solar System Maps

This project tries to give an idea of the scale of the Solar System by showing how big it would be, in Google Maps, if the Earth were the size of a basketball or other objects. It was inspired by this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR5VJo5ifdE - by Mark Rober.

My main goal was to learn Angular 2, and the bulk of its development was during Angular 2's beta phase.

Stuff that I used:
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
* [Angular Flex](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout)
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
* [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store)

Lots of improvement can be done, with internationalization, better layout, mobile version, among other stuff.
